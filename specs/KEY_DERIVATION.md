## 🔐 Metadata Key Derivation in LOCK

This document defines the standard key derivation function (KDF) for LOCK-compatible clients to securely encrypt and decrypt **vault metadata**. Correct implementation is required for client interoperability and secure access enforcement.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

LOCK does **not** store metadata encryption keys on-chain or in vaults.  
Instead, keys are **derived deterministically** using a secure key agreement mechanism (ECDH + HKDF), ensuring:

- No shared secrets  
- No manual key exchange  
- Predictable key generation across clients  
- Wallet-based access control  

---

## 📐 Design Overview

Each vault has an associated metadata encryption key.  
This key is derived using the following formula:

```plaintext
shared_secret = ECDH(private_key, vault_creator_pubkey)
metadata_key = HKDF-SHA256(
  input_key_material = shared_secret || seal_hash,
  salt = "LOCK-METADATA",
  info = "metadata-encryption-v1",
  output_length = 32 bytes
)
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vault_creator_pubkey` | The public key of the vault creator, used in the binding TX |
| `seal_hash` | SHA-256 hash of the SEAL file (32 bytes) |
| `salt` | Fixed string: `"LOCK-METADATA"` (used for domain separation) |
| `info` | Fixed string: `"metadata-encryption-v1"` (for versioning) |
| `output_length` | 32 bytes (suitable for AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305) |

---

## 🛠️ Inputs

### 1. **ECDH Shared Secret**

- Use ECDH to compute a shared secret between the unlocking wallet’s private key and the vault creator’s public key.

### 2. **seal_hash**

- The SHA-256 hash of the encrypted SEAL payload.  
- Clients must finalize the SEAL before computing the key.

---

## 🔄 Determinism & Compatibility

- Any client with the **SEAL** and valid key agreement setup can re-derive the same metadata key.
- This ensures metadata encryption is portable, stateless, and reproducible.

---

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- Do **not** derive keys from wallet mnemonics or expose private keys.
- Do **not** omit the `salt` or `info` fields — these ensure versioning and domain separation.
- Use only authenticated encryption with the derived key.
- Clients must clearly define how the vault creator’s public key is provided or derived.

---

## 🧪 Example (Pseudocode)

```python
def derive_metadata_key(private_key: bytes, peer_pubkey: bytes, seal: bytes) -> bytes:
    shared_secret = ecdh(private_key, peer_pubkey)
    seal_hash = sha256(seal)
    ikm = shared_secret + seal_hash
    return hkdf_sha256(
        ikm = ikm,
        salt = b"LOCK-METADATA",
        info = b"metadata-encryption-v1",
        length = 32
    )
```

---

## 🧩 Use in Vault Creation

The derived key is used to encrypt all vault metadata fields **before** binding.

Vaults with `visibility = plaintext` skip this step and store metadata unencrypted.

---

## ✍️ Sign-to-Decrypt Flow

Clients must prompt the user to sign a challenge (e.g., the vault_id) using an external wallet.

This signature is used to:

- Extract the pubkey of the signer
- Match that pubkey against `authorized_wallet`
  - If `authorized_wallet` is a list, match must occur within the list
  - If it's a string, match must equal that address
- Use the pubkey to derive shared secret via ECDH
- Then derive the metadata encryption key using HKDF

Only then can the vault metadata be decrypted.

---

## ✅ Compliance

Clients **must follow this derivation scheme** to be LOCK-compliant.  
Inconsistent derivation logic will lead to incompatible vaults and inaccessible metadata.

---

## 🔐 Encryption Compatibility

The derived `metadata_key` is suitable for:

- **AES-256-GCM** (Recommended default)
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305** (For mobile or performance-constrained environments)

The chosen algorithm must be declared in the vault metadata.
