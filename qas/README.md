   *Synergies, distinctions, and real-world product patterns for combining a secrecy primitive (Lock) with a stake-weighted identity primitive (OrangeCheck).*

> LOCK is best understood not as a product but as a **primitive**â€”like public-key cryptography or hash functions. It turns Bitcoinâ€™s thermodynamic finality into a programmable access layer. From micro-paywalled journalism to multi-sig enterprise secrets, from whistle-blower dead-manâ€™s switches to Taproot-embedded royalty splits, the design space stretches wide. This document captures the most pressing questionsâ€”obvious, obscure, philosophical, and forward-lookingâ€”to help builders reason about that space. If you have a question not answered here, open an issue or start a discussion; every hard question we ask now prevents a critical oversight later.
