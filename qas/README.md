## 1 Basic QAs
Fundamentals, terminology, and day-to-day operational clarifications for newcomers and implementers alike.

| **ID** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **B-1** | **What is LOCK in a nutshell?** | LOCK is a stateless, server-less access protocol that lets anybody encrypt a secret (a **SEAL**), cryptographically bind it to a *provable* Bitcoin transaction, and later decrypt it only if a new transaction satisfying preset “Proof-of-Access” (PoA) rules appears on-chain—no accounts, permissions, or custodial servers involved. |
| **B-2** | **What exactly is a SEAL file?** | A SEAL is a self-contained, versioned blob that bundles: ① the ciphertext of the secret, ② encrypted metadata describing how it may be unlocked, ③ an unencrypted header (format version, cipher suite, optional hints), and ④ a SHA-256 digest that becomes the vault’s canonical ID. You can store a SEAL anywhere a byte sequence fits—S3, IPFS, e-mail attachment, QR code, or cold USB stick. |
| **B-3** | **What does “sealing” mean in practice?** | *Sealing* is the one-time act of serialising the plaintext, choosing unlock conditions, deriving a symmetric key (ECDH → HKDF), and encrypting with an AEAD cipher (AES-256-GCM by default). The output is the SEAL blob; nothing touches the Bitcoin network yet. |
| **B-4** | **And “binding”?** | Binding is where a Bitcoin transaction that matches the metadata rules is created, signed, broadcast, confirmed, and frozen (non-replaceable). That transaction—by virtue of burning fees and spending real UTXOs—proves the user’s commitment of energy or value, satisfying the vault’s PoA requirements. |
| **B-5** | **What is Proof-of-Access?** | PoA is an off-chain validation routine run by any compliant client. Given a candidate transaction’s txid, it checks: correct spender script, correct fee/amount range, correct recipient, required confirmations, optional timelocks or `nLockTime`, and valid signatures. If all pass, the client derives the key, decrypts the SEAL, and returns the plaintext. |
| **B-6** | **Does the txid itself enter key derivation?** | No. LOCK derives keys solely from the sealer’s ECDH secret, the unlocker’s pubkey, and **the SEAL hash** as both *salt* and *info* in HKDF. Ignoring the txid immunises the scheme against RBF, CPFP, and malleability. |
| **B-7** | **Why AES-256-GCM and what is AEAD?** | AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) ciphers give confidentiality *and* integrity in one pass. AES-256-GCM is hardware-accelerated on most CPUs, well-audited, and constant-time. ChaCha20-Poly1305 can be swapped in where AES acceleration is missing (IoT, mobiles). |
| **B-8** | **What is a PSBT and why bother?** | A Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) is a BIP-174 container that cleanly separates deterministic data (inputs/outputs) from signatures. Wallets can add signatures without exposing private keys, multisig cosigners can collaborate, and air-gapped signers can round-trip the file via QR or micro-SD. |
| **B-9** | **What’s inside a PSBT “per-input map”?** | Each input map can hold the full previous transaction, partial sigs, redeem/witness scripts, Taproot leaf proofs, `sighash` flags, and proprietary records. Different devices append their own keys while preserving what others added—hence “map.” |
| **B-10** | **Can vaults enforce multisig spends?** | Yes. The metadata only says, “this **scriptPubKey** must authorise the spend.” That script can be P2PKH, P2WPKH, 2-of-3 multisig under P2WSH, or a Taproot tree. LOCK itself is agnostic; PoA just checks that the *final* tx is valid for that script. |

## 2 Product QAs
Implementation strategies, business models, and real-world product concepts that showcase the protocol’s capabilities.

| **ID** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **P-1** | **What is the simplest viable product on top of LOCK?** | A “Bitcoin Pay-to-Unlock” file-sharing site: drag-and-drop a file, specify unlock price and receiving address, receive a SEAL link. Viewers pay the amount with their own wallet; the site watches mempool, runs PoA, and streams the decrypted file. |
| **P-2** | **How would a *SaaS API key vending* service work?** | Encrypt the API key in a SEAL; metadata requires payment ≥ ₿0.00002 to a designated address. When a client pays, the PoA engine releases the key and optionally triggers a webhook that writes the spender’s address to your allowlist database. |
| **P-3** | **Could LOCK power a Patreon-style subscription?** | Yes, via *unlock-limit* metadata. Seal a month’s content bundle with a limit of `N=1` unlock per subscription term. Each subscriber must pay the required fee every month to decrypt the new bundle; your front-end merely automates invoice generation. |
| **P-4** | **How about “Bitcoin ticketing” for events?** | Seal the QR-code entry token; metadata: pay X sats to a stadium treasury address + include an OP_RETURN with event ID. Gate scanners run PoA, verify the txid, and mark the seat as used. No e-mail, no custodian tickets. |
| **P-5** | **Can we build a Dead-Man’s Switch?** | Encrypt the payload (keys, manifesto) with metadata requiring *anyone* to spend ≥ 1 M sats to a charity address *after* block H+n. If the owner stays alive, they periodically refactor the metadata to push the block height forward; otherwise the secret auto-publishes when someone pays. |
| **P-6** | **What UX hurdles must products overcome?** | 1) Surfacing *why* a payment failed (bad amount, wrong address, not enough confirmations). 2) Abstracting PSBT signing flows across hardware, mobile, and browser wallets. 3) Hosting the SEAL reliably and redundantly. |
| **P-7** | **Is there a path to a *zero-backend* dApp?** | Yes. A pure client-side web app can embed the PoA logic in WASM, fetch SEALs from IPFS, monitor transactions via publicly-indexed electrum servers, and decrypt locally—no dedicated servers needed. |
| **P-8** | **How would royalties or revenue split be enforced?** | Metadata can specify multiple recipient outputs with required ratios (`amount_condition: ">=100000", recipients: ["addrA:60%", "addrB:40%"]`). The unlocking transaction must satisfy the split; otherwise PoA fails. |
| **P-9** | **Can we meter *per-API-call* instead of per-file?** | Use *progressive secrets*: encrypt an ephemeral token valid for `N` API calls and require a fee each time the limit is reached. Alternatively, seal the long-lived API key but wrap calls in a counter enforced by *usage receipts* stored in a Merkle tree. |
| **P-10** | **What about mobile?** | Mobile wallets increasingly support PSBT (BlueWallet, Sparrow, Nunchuk). A companion React Native SDK could embed: PSBT builder, scanner, PoA verifier, and local decrypter, making LOCK-based paywalls as easy as scanning a QR then tapping “Sign & Unlock.” |

## 3 Security QAs
Threat analyses, cryptographic gotchas, and implementation land-mines to avoid.

| **ID** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **S-1** | **What if someone re-uses a transaction to open *multiple* vaults?** | Metadata should include the *vault ID* as additional authenticated data (AAD) in the cipher. A single tx will then only decrypt vaults that incorporated its ID in their HKDF context, preventing cross-vault replay. |
| **S-2** | **Could low-entropy IVs doom the entire system?** | Yes. AES-GCM catastrophically fails on IV collision. Clients must generate a fresh 96-bit nonce per seal using a CSPRNG and include test-vector self-checks in CI. |
| **S-3** | **How to handle chain re-orgs?** | PoA engines should wait `N ≥ 6` confirmations before deriving the key. For high-value vaults, allow configurable depth or require *CheckPoints* anchored via an external timestamping service (e.g., OpenTimestamps). |
| **S-4** | **Can a malicious host feed me a doctored SEAL?** | The sealer should publish the SEAL hash (vault ID) in a verifiable channel (e.g., Nostr, Git, or their website). Decrypters check that the downloaded blob’s hash matches before wasting time on PoA. |
| **S-5** | **Is metadata confidentiality guaranteed?** | Only if every field is encrypted. Template code must default to *encrypt-all*, with a CLI flag to mark specific fields as public. Document this loudly to prevent accidental leakage of business rules or personal data. |
| **S-6** | **How to prevent *fee sniping* (broadcasting a dust tx to front-run)?** | Require a **minimum feerate** in metadata. PoA rejects any tx below X sat/vB. Honest unlockers pay competitive fees, snipers waste dust or get stuck in mempool. |
| **S-7** | **What about quantum attacks on ECDH?** | If and when post-quantum algorithms mature, the protocol could swap ECDH for Kyber or ML-KEM while keeping HKDF + AEAD unchanged. Including the cipher suite in the plaintext header makes future negotiation straightforward. |
| **S-8** | **Does LOCK create new privacy leaks on-chain?** | Not inherently. Vault IDs are never written to the blockchain unless the implementer deliberately embeds them in an OP_RETURN. The spend looks like any ordinary P2WPKH or P2TR payment. |

## 4 Pragmatic QAs
Larger philosophical and ecosystem questions—*why* LOCK matters and how it fits into Bitcoin’s socio-technical landscape.

| **ID** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **PR-1** | **Why anchor secrets to *energy expenditure* instead of identity?** | Proof-of-Work is the most censorship-resistant primitive Bitcoin offers. By tying decryption rights to thermodynamically provable action, LOCK sidesteps KYC choke-points, revocation lists, and account hacking. The cost to unlock is objective, not discretionary. |
| **PR-2** | **Isn’t this just DRM on steroids?** | It *can* enable pay-per-view DRM, but it equally enables whistle-blower dead-man switches, charity fund-raisers, and non-custodial ticketing. The protocol is value-neutral; its moral valence depends on use-case. |
| **PR-3** | **How does LOCK interact with Bitcoin’s philosophy of self-sovereignty?** | By removing permissioned intermediaries, LOCK extends self-custody from “who holds my coins?” to “who controls my data?” It lets people *prove* access through voluntary energy sacrifice rather than appeal to authority. |
| **PR-4** | **Could miners censor unlock transactions?** | Miners *can* ignore low-fee txs, but censorship is economically costly in an open mempool. Vault owners can counter by designing metadata that accepts *any* spend from a given script, letting third parties CPFP the transaction if needed. |
| **PR-5** | **Does LOCK compete with Lightning paywalls?** | They address different layers. Lightning excels at instant micro-payments for *streaming* data. LOCK excels at single, irreversible, content-gated unlocks that must remain verifiable forever. In many apps they’re complementary. |
| **PR-6** | **Could LOCK accelerate Bitcoin circular economies?** | Yes. If valuable digital goods—academic papers, indie games, SaaS features—are gated by on-chain proof rather than fiat gateways, earn-spend loops inside Bitcoin strengthen. Creators receive sats directly; consumers need sats to unlock. |

## 5 Future QAs
Open research fronts, roadmap possibilities, and speculative directions.

| **ID** | **Question** | **Answer** |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **F-1** | **Formal verification roadmap?** | Transcribe the PoA state machine into TLA+ and prove liveness (an unlock always succeeds if conditions are met) and safety (impossible to decrypt without a valid PoA). Then machine-generate conformance tests for every reference library. |
| **F-2** | **Native Taproot commitments?** | Future versions could embed the vault ID inside a Taproot leaf, allowing the PoA engine to verify inclusion without OP_RETURN bloat. This would also enable *pay to vault* primitives where the secret is discoverable only by probing Taproot paths. |
| **F-3** | **Oracle-driven conditional unlocks?** | Combine DLC-style adaptor signatures: metadata states “unlock if BTC/USD > $100 k.” An oracle posts a signature that finalises the transaction when the condition is true, automatically revealing the decryption key. |
| **F-4** | **Inter-chain PoA?** | Research bridging PoA to other PoW chains (Litecoin, Dogecoin) or even PoS chains using SPV proofs and light-client Merkle embeddings. The vault could accept *any* chain meeting a difficulty threshold. |
| **F-5** | **Zero-knowledge vault discovery?** | Use ZK-SNARKs to prove you hold a tx satisfying metadata *without* revealing which tx it is, allowing anonymous unlocking where only the decrypter gains the plaintext but observers can’t link payment to content. |
| **F-6** | **Economic research agenda?** | Model an *unlock market* where price discovery (fee + amount) equilibrates between content creators and consumers. Simulate miner extractable value (MEV) incentives around high-value unlocks and design fee ceilings. |
